    <h1>AI4Marketing</h1>
    
    <p>Hi everyone! Welcome to AI4Marketing open-source research group.</p>
    
    <p>In recent months, AI applications have made remarkable strides, promising to unlock unprecedented levels of human creativity and productivity—while driving improvements across engineering, healthcare, education, entertainment, and beyond.</p>
    
    <p>Unicorns able to deliver early values have emerged, with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition_AI" target="_blank">Cognition Labs</a> (now valued at <a href="https://cognition.ai/blog/funding-growth-and-the-next-frontier-of-ai-coding-agents" target="_blank">10.2B</a>), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anysphere" target="_blank">Cursor</a> (valued at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/05/cursors-anysphere-nabs-9-9b-valuation-soars-past-500m-arr/" target="_blank">9.9B</a>) helping software engineers, <a href="https://pika.art/" target="_blank">Pika</a> (valued at <a href="https://securityonline.info/meta-eyes-pika-labs-a-potential-500m-acquisition-to-accelerate-ai-video-generation/" target="_blank">4B</a>), <a href="https://runwayml.com/" target="_blank">Runway</a> (valued at <a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/ai-runway-raises-308-million-funding-valuation-1236358677/" target="_blank">3B</a>), <a href="https://lumalabs.ai/" target="_blank">Luma</a> (valued at <a href="https://www.techinasia.com/news/us-ai-firms-runway-luma-seek-billions-in-new-funding-rounds#:~:text=Runway%20and%20Luma%20AI%2C%20startups,million%20annualized%20pace%20by%20December." target="_blank">3.2B</a>) helping video creators, <a href="https://mercor.com/" target="_blank">Mercor</a> (valued at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/20/mercor-an-ai-recruiting-startup-founded-by-21-year-olds-raises-100m-at-2b-valuation/" target="_blank">10B</a>) for human resources specialists, <a href="https://www.harvey.ai/" target="_blank">Harvey</a> (valued at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/23/four-months-after-a-3b-valuation-harvey-ai-grows-to-5b/" target="_blank">5B</a>) for lawyers, <a href="https://www.clay.com/" target="_blank">Clay</a> (valued at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/05/clay-confirms-it-closed-100m-round-at-3-1b-valuation/" target="_blank">3.1B</a>) for go-to-market, <a href="https://www.chaidiscovery.com/" target="_blank">Chai</a> (<a href="https://www.biopharmatrend.com/news/chai-discovery-raises-70m-to-expand-zero-shot-biologics-design-ai-platform-1331/" target="_blank">1.2B</a>) for biologists, <a href="https://axiommath.ai/blog/" target="_blank">Axiommath</a> for mathematicians, <a href="https://moonlakeai.com/" target="_blank">Moonlake</a> for game developers, <a href="https://www.utopaistudios.com/" target="_blank">Utopai</a> for film-makers, <a href="https://www.tryshortcut.ai/shortcut" target="_blank">Shortcut</a> and <a href="https://www.maximor.ai/" target="_blank">Maximor</a> for financial analysis, <a href="https://listenlabs.ai/" target="_blank">ListenLabs</a> for customer support, not to list all of them.</p>
    
    <p>Here, we hope to contribute to the marketing industries. One reason AI4Marketing has yet to produce a breakout unicorn is that the underlying research remains relatively underdeveloped. To help change that, we aim to launch a permissively open-source research initiative—designed to unite academic and public efforts across AI, HCI, social sciences, business, and beyond.</p>
    
    <p>True to our open-source philosophy, all deliverables will be public from day one. We will not maintain any private repositories under our GitHub organization, ensuring full transparency and attribution. Every contributor will receive due credit, and we collectively aim to produce work of the highest quality—worthy of publication at top-tier AI conferences.</p>
    
    <p>You are also more than welcome to launch your own startups based on what we build here. In fact, we see immense potential for numerous unicorns to emerge from AI4Marketing research effort. AI-native startups, even within the same field, are not competitors with each other—they are allies challenging the old giants still clinging to traditional ways of doing things.</p>
    
    <h2>Organizing Committee:</h2>
    
    <p><a href="https://hokindeng.github.io/" target="_blank">Hokin Deng</a> will serve as the leading coordinator for this research community for now, with the gratefully support from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/annaliang2024/" target="_blank">Anna Liang</a> and her startup <a href="https://www.thesocialq.ai/" target="_blank">SocialQ</a>. But we are very excited for people to be interested in serving the new research field and community and we deeply thank you for your services.</p>
    
    <p>If you're a startup or company working in related fields and are interested in supporting our research, we'd love to hear from you—your collaboration would be deeply appreciated.</p>
    
    <h2>Research Pondering</h2>
    
    <p>Our research is motivated by a breakdown of the roles within a typical social marketing team in traditional companies. This decomposition leads us to pursue two parallel research directions: ViralBench and POGA (Prompt Optimization for Generative AI).</p>
    
    <p>Social marketing today requires a nuanced understanding of platform algorithms, emerging trends, brand playbooks, cultural codes, and strategic timing. Once these insights are gathered, they are often handed off to creative teams responsible for producing short-form, high-impact videos for platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube.</p>
    
    <p>We see a natural division here:</p>
    <p>The first arm, focused on insight generation and strategic reasoning, is well-suited for augmentation by agentic AI systems.</p>
    <p>The second arm, centered on content creation, aligns with the capabilities of generative video models.</p>
    
    <p>However, two urgent research gaps remain:</p>
    
    <p><strong>Evaluation Gap for Social Marketing Agents → ViralBench</strong></p>
    <p>There is currently no standardized or meaningful way to evaluate whether AI agents actually "understand" social marketing or can reason about what makes content go viral.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Steerability Gap for Creative Tools → POGA</strong></p>
    <p>Many creators find today's generative video models difficult to control and unreliable in execution.</p>
    <p>POGA (Prompt Optimization for Generative AI) aims to build systems that help creators better steer generative models toward desired outcomes—bridging the gap between creative intent and generative output.</p>
    
    <p>We believe these are some of the most urgent and impactful research problems in the emerging intersection of AI, creativity, and social media.</p>
